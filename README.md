# PUBG Finish Placement Prediction - Machine Learning Project ENSAE 2020

In a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match (matchId). Players can be on teams (groupId) which get ranked at the end of the game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. In game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves. 

The aim of this project is to create a model which predicts players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place).
